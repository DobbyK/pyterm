# pyterm
A Open Source Terminal you can use written entirely in python, uses OS to run the terminal, and my own code to cd to stuff. Using Github you can have unlimited files for free and run it. Even works with online code runners. So you can have a fully featured terminal no download, and unlimited storage with github!
